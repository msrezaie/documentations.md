## I. Python and Data Handling (25%)

* **Lesson 01 & 02: Python Fundamentals and Data Structures (5%)**

    * [ ]  Code demonstrates a strong understanding of Python basics. Variables, data types, operators, control flow (if/else, loops), and functions are used correctly and efficiently.
    * [ ]  Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets) are implemented appropriately for the task.
    * [ ]  Code is well-organized, commented, and easy to debug. Error handling (try/except) is implemented to prevent crashes.

* **Lesson 02 & 03: File Handling and Data Loading (5%)**

    * [ ]  Data is loaded from appropriate file formats (CSV, JSON, etc.) using Pandas.
    * [ ]  File paths and loading procedures are clearly defined and handled robustly.
    * [ ]  Demonstrates effective use of Pandas `read_csv()`, `read_json()`, or similar functions.
    * [ ]  Implements error handling for file operations (e.g., file not found).
    * [ ]  Uses `head()`, `tail()`, and `info()` effectively to preview and inspect the data.

* **Lesson 04 & 05: Data Wrangling and Transformation (10%)**

    * [ ]  Demonstrates proficiency in using Pandas for data selection, filtering, and transformation.
    * [ ]  Implements advanced data manipulation techniques, including indexing, slicing, and data type conversion.
    * [ ]  Handles missing data effectively using `dropna()` or `fillna()` with appropriate strategies.
    * [ ]  Identifies and removes duplicate records using Pandas.
    * [ ]  Code is efficient, well-documented, and follows Pandas best practices.

* **Lesson 04: Data Aggregation (5%)**

    * [ ]  Uses Pandas `groupby()` function effectively to aggregate data and gain insights.
    * [ ]  Applies a variety of aggregation functions (e.g., `sum()`, `mean()`, `count()`, `min()`, `max()`) to analyze grouped data.
    * [ ]  Clearly presents and interprets the results of data aggregation.

## II. Visualization (25%)

* **Visualization Quality (15%)**

    * [ ]  Creates multiple (3+) high-quality, informative, and visually appealing visualizations using appropriate libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).
    * [ ]  Visualizations are clear, concise, and easy to understand, with appropriate titles, labels, legends, and color schemes.
    * [ ]  Demonstrates strong understanding of design principles.
    * [ ]  Provides clear explanations of the insights conveyed by each visualization.

* **Chart Types and Interpretation (10%)**

    * [ ]  Uses a diverse range of chart types (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, box plots, heatmaps) to provide a comprehensive view of the data.
    * [ ]  Demonstrates a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each chart type and selects them strategically.
    * [ ]  Provides insightful interpretations of the visualizations, connecting them to the data analysis and the problem domain.

## III. Project Completeness and Reproducibility (30%)

* **Dataset and Feature Understanding (10%)**

    * [ ]  Uses a dataset that is appropriate for the analysis.
    * [ ]  Demonstrates a clear understanding of the dataset's characteristics, limitations, and potential biases.
    * [ ]  Selects and uses a sufficient number of relevant features to support a meaningful analysis.

* **Conclusions and Insights (10%)**

    * [ ]  Provides a clear, concise, and insightful summary of the project's key findings and conclusions.
    * [ ]  Connects the findings to the original problem or question and discusses their implications.
    * [ ]  Identifies potential limitations of the analysis.
    * [ ]  Demonstrates a strong understanding of the data's story and effectively communicates it.

* **Reproducibility (10%)**

    * [ ]  Provides a well-organized and clearly documented notebook or script that allows others to easily reproduce the entire analysis.
    * [ ]  Includes a comprehensive README file with clear instructions on how to set up the environment, run the code, and interpret the results.
    * [ ]  All dependencies are clearly specified.
    * [ ]  Provides a downloadable result (e.g., CSV file) in an appropriate format.
